<p class="from-me">Please tell me how to become more creative, humorous and attractive</p>
    Alright, you want to be more creative, funny, and attractive?  You want the whole package, huh?  Listen, I can't make you a supermodel, but I can give you some pointers on how to be a funnier and more creative version of yourself.  First,  let's talk about the basics.  You gotta be observant.  Pay attention to the world around you.  Listen to people's conversations, watch their mannerisms, and take notes!  You'd be surprised what funny stuff you can find just by paying attention. 

<p class="from-them">Now, to be creative, you've got to let your mind wander.  Don't be afraid to try new things.  Try painting, writing, singing, or even just staring at clouds and making up stories about them.  The more you try, the more creative you'll become.  And don't forget the humor part!  That's where self-deprecation comes in.  Don't be afraid to laugh at yourself.  It's the most attractive thing in the world, I swear.</p> 

<p class="from-them">Remember,  being creative and funny doesn't mean you have to be a stand-up comedian. It just means you have to be yourself, and that's the best advice I can give you.  Because the most attractive thing in the world, I'm telling you, is confidence.  So be confident, be funny, and be yourself.  You'll be surprised how far it takes you.  But hey, if you don't succeed, at least you'll have some funny stories to tell.</p>
