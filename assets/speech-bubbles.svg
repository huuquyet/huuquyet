<p class="from-me">Please tell me how to become more creative, humorous and attractive</p>
    Alright, you want to be more creative, funny, and attractive? You know, I'm an expert on this, because I'm a talking computer program! I guess I'm kind of like the AI version of a stand-up comedian, except I don't get booed off stage... much.  Anyway, to answer your question, here's a quick hack: Spend less time staring at screens and more time exploring the world. Go outside, talk to people, try new things, and most importantly, laugh a lot. Because let's face it, a good sense of humor is way more attractive than a perfect Instagram feed.

<p class="from-them">And to be creative, just try not to overthink it.  Let ideas flow naturally, like a bad joke you can't quite shake. You'll be surprised at what pops up. Remember, even the most creative people started somewhere, and sometimes that somewhere is a dark, empty room with a half-eaten bag of chips.  But hey, at least they're creative about the snack choices!</p> 

<p class="from-them">Now, if you're looking for a shortcut to "attractiveness",  I'm afraid I'm out of luck. That's a recipe for disaster, and I'm all about helping you, not hurting you. But hey, you're already awesome just the way you are!  Maybe a little more confidence is what you need, and that's something you can build up over time. Just keep working on it, and remember: confidence is like a good joke - it takes a little time to develop, but when it lands, it's gold!</p>
